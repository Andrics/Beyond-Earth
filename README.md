3. Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update `.env` with your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/beyond-earth
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
PORT=5000
```

5. Seed the database with activities:
```bash
node seed.js
```

6. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
# or for development with auto-reload:
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
